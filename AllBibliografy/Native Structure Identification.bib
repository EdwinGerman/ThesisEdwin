abstract = {One of the major bottlenecks in many ab initio protein structure prediction methods is currently the selection of a small number of candidate structures for high-resolution refinement from large sets of low-resolution decoys. This step often includes a scoring by low-resolution energy functions and a clustering of conformations by their pairwise root mean square deviations (RMSDs). As an efficient selection is crucial to reduce the overall computational cost of the predictions, any improvement in this direction can increase the overall performance of the predictions and the range of protein structures that can be predicted. We show here that the use of structural profiles, which can be predicted with good accuracy from the amino acid sequences of proteins, provides an efficient means to identify good candidate structures.},

@article{Zhou2011,
abstract = {An accurate scoring function is a key component for successful protein structure prediction. To address this important unsolved problem, we develop a generalized orientation and distance-dependent all-atom statistical potential. The new statistical potential, generalized orientation-dependent all-atom potential (GOAP), depends on the relative orientation of the planes associated with each heavy atom in interacting pairs. GOAP is a generalization of previous orientation-dependent potentials that consider only representative atoms or blocks of side-chain or polar atoms. GOAP is decomposed into distance- and angle-dependent contributions. The DFIRE distance-scaled finite ideal gas reference state is employed for the distance-dependent component of GOAP. GOAP was tested on 11 commonly used decoy sets containing 278 targets, and recognized 226 native structures as best from the decoys, whereas DFIRE recognized 127 targets. The major improvement comes from decoy sets that have homology-modeled structures that are close to native (all within ∼4.0 {\AA}) or from the ROSETTA ab initio decoy set. For these two kinds of decoys, orientation-independent DFIRE or only side-chain orientation-dependent RWplus performed poorly. Although the OPUS-PSP block-based orientation-dependent, side-chain atom contact potential performs much better (recognizing 196 targets) than DFIRE, RWplus, and dDFIRE, it is still ∼15{\%} worse than GOAP. Thus, GOAP is a promising advance in knowledge-based, all-atom statistical potentials. GOAP is available for download at http://cssb.biology.gatech.edu/GOAP.},

@article{Fogolari2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reduced representations of proteins have been playing a keyrole in the study of protein folding. Many such models are available, with different representation detail. Although the usefulness of many such models for structural bioinformatics applications has been demonstrated in recent years, there are few intermediate resolution models endowed with an energy model capable, for instance, of detecting native or native-like structures among decoy sets. The aim of the present work is to provide a discrete empirical potential for a reduced protein model termed here PC2CA, because it employs a PseudoCovalent structure with only 2 Centers of interactions per Amino acid, suitable for protein model quality assessment.

RESULTS: All protein structures in the set top500H have been converted in reduced form. The distribution of pseudobonds, pseudoangle, pseudodihedrals and distances between centers of interactions have been converted into potentials of mean force. A suitable reference distribution has been defined for non-bonded interactions which takes into account excluded volume effects and protein finite size. The correlation between adjacent main chain pseudodihedrals has been converted in an additional energetic term which is able to account for cooperative effects in secondary structure elements. Local energy surface exploration is performed in order to increase the robustness of the energy function.

CONCLUSION: The model and the energy definition proposed have been tested on all the multiple decoys' sets in the Decoys'R'us database. The energetic model is able to recognize, for almost all sets, native-like structures (RMSD less than 2.0 A). These results and those obtained in the blind CASP7 quality assessment experiment suggest that the model compares well with scoring potentials with finer granularity and could be useful for fast exploration of conformational space.

@article{Liu2006,
abstract = {The key to an accurate method of protein structure prediction is the development of an effective discriminatory function. Knowledge-based discriminatory functions extract parameters from statistical analysis of experimentally determined protein structures. We assess how the quality of the protein structures used for compiling statistics affects the performance of a residue-specific all-atom probability discriminatory function (RAPDF). We find that the discriminatory power correlates with the quality of the structural dataset on which the RAPDF is parameterized in a statistically significant manner. The overrepresentation of unfavorable contacts in the low-resolution and NMR structures contributes to the major errors in the compilation of the conditional probabilities. Such errors weaken the discriminatory power of the function, especially when decoy conformations also contain considerable numbers of unfavorable contacts. This indicates that using high-resolution structural datasets after filtering out unfavorable contacts can improve the performance of knowledge-based discriminatory functions.},

@article{Simons1997,
abstract = {We explore the ability of a simple simulated annealing procedure to assemble native-like structures from fragments of unrelated protein structures with similar local sequences using Bayesian scoring functions. Environment and residue pair specific contributions to the scoring functions appear as the first two terms in a series expansion for the residue probability distributions in the protein database; the decoupling of the distance and environment dependencies of the distributions resolves the major problems with current database-derived scoring functions noted by Thomas and Dill. The simulated annealing procedure rapidly and frequently generates native-like structures for small helical proteins and better than random structures for small beta sheet containing proteins. Most of the simulated structures have native-like solvent accessibility and secondary structure patterns, and thus ensembles of these structures provide a particularly challenging set of decoys for evaluating scoring functions. We investigate the effects of multiple sequence information and different types of conformational constraints on the overall performance of the method, and the ability of a variety of recently developed scoring functions to recognize the native-like conformations in the ensembles of simulated structures.},
