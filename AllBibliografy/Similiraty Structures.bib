abstract = {MOTIVATION: Most methods that are used to compare protein structures use three-dimensional (3D) structural information. At the same time, it has been shown that a 1D string representation of local protein structure retains a degree of structural information. This type of representation can be a powerful tool for protein structure comparison and classification, given the arsenal of sequence comparison tools developed by computational biology. However, in order to do so, there is a need to first understand how much information is contained in various possible 1D representations of protein structure. RESULTS: Here we describe the use of a particular structure fragment library, denoted here as KL-strings, for the 1D representation of protein structure. Using KL-strings, we develop an infrastructure for comparing protein structures with a 1D representation. This study focuses on the added value gained from such a description. We show the new local structure language adds resolution to the traditional three-state (helix, strand and coil) secondary structure description, and provides a high degree of accuracy in recognizing structural similarities when used with a pairwise alignment benchmark. The results of this study have immediate applications towards fast structure recognition, and for fold prediction and classification.},

@article{Betancourt2001,
abstract = {We introduce a new variant of the root mean square distance (RMSD) for comparing protein structures whose range of values is independent of protein size. This new dimensionless measure (relative RMSD, or RRMSD) is zero between identical structures and one between structures that are as globally dissimilar as an average pair of random polypeptides of respective sizes. The RRMSD probability distribution between random polypeptides converges to a universal curve as the chain length increases. The correlation coefficients between aligned random structures are computed as a function of polypeptide size showing two characteristic lengths of 4.7 and 37 residues. These lengths mark the separation between phases of different structural order between native protein fragments. The implications for threading are discussed.},

@article{Krasnogor2004,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: As an increasing number of protein structures become available, the need for algorithms that can quantify the similarity between protein structures increases as well. Thus, the comparison of proteins' structures, and their clustering accordingly to a given similarity measure, is at the core of today's biomedical research. In this paper, we show how an algorithmic information theory inspired Universal Similarity Metric (USM) can be used to calculate similarities between protein pairs. The method, besides being theoretically supported, is surprisingly simple to implement and computationally efficient. RESULTS: Structural similarity between proteins in four different datasets was measured using the USM. The sample employed represented alpha, beta, alpha-beta, tim-barrel, globins and serpine protein types. The use of the proposed metric allows for a correct measurement of similarity and classification of the proteins in the four datasets. AVAILABILITY: All the scripts and programs used for the preparation of this paper are available at http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/{\~{}}nxk/USM/protocol.html. In that web-page the reader will find a brief description on how to use the various scripts and programs.},

@article{Zhang2004b,
abstract = {We have developed a new scoring function, the template modeling score (TM-score), to assess the quality of protein structure templates and predicted full-length models by extending the approaches used in Global Distance Test (GDT)1 and MaxSub.2 First, a protein size-dependent scale is exploited to eliminate the inherent protein size dependence of the previous scores and appropriately account for random protein structure pairs. Second, rather than setting specific distance cutoffs and calculating only the fractions with errors below the cutoff, all residue pairs in alignment/modeling are evaluated in the proposed score. For comparison of various scoring functions, we have constructed a large-scale benchmark set of structure templates for 1489 small to medium size proteins using the threading program PROSPECTOR{\_}3 and built the full-length models using MODELLER and TASSER. The TM-score of the initial threading alignments, compared to the GDT and MaxSub scoring functions, shows a much stronger correlation to the quality of the final full-length models. The TM-score is further exploited as an assessment of all 'new fold' targets in the recent CASP5 experiment and shows a close coincidence with the results of human-expert visual assessment. These data suggest that the TM-score is a useful complement to the fully automated assessment of protein structure predictions. The executable program of TM-score is freely downloadable at http://bioinformatics.buffalo.edu/TM-score.},

@article{Gupta2005,
abstract = {Prediction of fold from amino acid sequence of a protein has been an active area of research in the past few years, but the limited accuracy of existing techniques emphasizes the need to develop newer approaches to tackle this task. In this study, we use contact map prediction as an intermediate step in fold prediction from sequence. Contact map is a reduced graph-theoretic representation of proteins that models the local and global inter-residue contacts in the structure. We start with a population of random contact maps for the protein sequence and "evolve" the population to a "high-feasibility" configuration using a genetic algorithm. A neural network is employed to assess the feasibility of contact maps based on their 4 physically relevant properties. We also introduce 5 parameters, based on algebraic graph theory and physical considerations, that can be used to judge the structural similarity between proteins through contact maps. To predict the fold of a given amino acid sequence, we predict a contact map that will sufficiently approximate the structure of the corresponding protein. Then we assess the similarity of this contact map with the representative contact map of each fold; the fold that corresponds to the closest match is our predicted fold for the input sequence. We have found that our feasibility measure is able to differentiate between feasible and infeasible contact maps. Further, this novel approach is able to predict the folds from sequences significantly better than a random predictor.},
