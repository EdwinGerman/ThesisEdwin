abstract = {Capability of evolutionary neural network (ENN) based QSAR approach to direct the descriptor selection process towards stable descriptor subset (DS) composition characterized by acceptable generalization, as well as the influence of description stability on QSAR model interpretation have been examined. In order to analyze the DS stability and QSAR model generalization properties multiple random dataset partitions into training and test set were made. Acceptability criteria proposed by Golbraikh et al. [J. Comput.-Aided Mol. Des., 17 (2003) 241] have been chosen for selection of highly predictive QSAR models from a set of all models produced by ENN for each dataset splitting. All QSAR models that pass Golbraikh's filter generated by ENN for each dataset partition were collected. Two final DS forming principles were compared. Standard principle is based on selection of descriptors characterized by highest frequencies among all descriptors that appear in the pool [J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci., 43 (2003) 949]. Search across the model pool for DS that are stable against multiple dataset subsampling i.e. universal DS solutions is the basis of novel approach. Based on described principles benzodiazepine QSAR has been proposed and evaluated against results reported by others in terms of final DS composition and model predictive performance.},

abstract = {Feature selection is an important part of contemporary QSAR analysis. In a recently published paper, we investigated the performance of different feature selection methods in a large number of in silico experiments conducted using real QSAR datasets. However, an interesting question that we did not address is whether certain feature selection methods are better than others in combination with certain learning methods, in terms of producing models with high prediction accuracy. In this report we extend our work from the previous investigation by using four different feature selection methods (wrapper, ReliefF, MARS, and elastic nets), together with eight learners (MARS, elastic net, random forest, SVM, neural networks, multiple linear regression, PLS, kNN) in an empirical investigation to address this question. The results indicate that state-of-the-art learners (random forest, SVM, and neural networks) do not gain prediction accuracy from feature selection, and we found no evidence that a certain feature selection is particularly well-suited for use in combination with a certain learner.},

abstract = {The intestine is an exceptionally rich ecosystem encompassing a complex interaction among microorganisms, influenced by host factors, ingested food, and liquid. Characterizing the intestinal microbiota is currently an active area of research. Various molecular-based methods are available to characterize the intestinal microbiota, but all methods possess relative strengths, as well as salient weaknesses. It is important that researchers are cognizant of the limitations of these methods, and that they take the appropriate steps to mitigate weaknesses. Here, we discuss methodologies used to monitor intestinal bacteria including: (i) traditional clone libraries; (ii) direct sequencing using next-generation parallel sequencing technology; (iii) denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis; (iv) terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis; (v) fluorescent in situ hybridization; and (vi) quantitative PCR. In addition, we also discuss experimental design, sample collection and storage, DNA extraction, gene targets, PCR bias, and methods to reduce PCR bias.},
