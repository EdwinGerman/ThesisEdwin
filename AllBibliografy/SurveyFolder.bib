abstract = {An essential requirement for computational protein structure prediction is a score function that discriminates native-like from non-native conformations. Contemporary score functions are either physics-based energy functions or knowledge potencials. Physics-based anergy funtions attemps to model the physical interactions responsible for protein stability. Knowledge-base approaches derive amino acid interaction statistics from experimentally determined protein structures and cast them into "pseudo-energies". These latter approaches are typefied by united atom representations of residues and the assumption that the energy of a protein conformation can be computed as the summation of pair potencials. This neglect of higher order and detailed atomic interactions hinder their effectiveness. The objective of this thesis was to investigate score functions that addressed these two issues. There are five main results from this work. The first is that the geometrically regular way in wish residues pack in protein structures, based on the dense packing of spheres, does not appear to be a useful score function basis. The second result is the development of a novel resiude-level burial term that is sensitive to fine-grained packing density. Third is the introduction of a score function that evaluates amino acid combination preference in residue neighborhoods and offers an alternative to pairwise methods. Fouth is the introduction of hight resolution score functions for post processing the result of low resolution score functions. The final result is the observations that the widely used decoy sets are problematic and that any conclusions based in them must be treated with caution.},

abstract = {The key to an accurate method of protein structure prediction is the development of an effective discriminatory function. Knowledge-based discriminatory functions extract parameters from statistical analysis of experimentally determined protein structures. We assess how the quality of the protein structures used for compiling statistics affects the performance of a residue-specific all-atom probability discriminatory function (RAPDF). We find that the discriminatory power correlates with the quality of the structural dataset on which the RAPDF is parameterized in a statistically significant manner. The overrepresentation of unfavorable contacts in the low-resolution and NMR structures contributes to the major errors in the compilation of the conditional probabilities. Such errors weaken the discriminatory power of the function, especially when decoy conformations also contain considerable numbers of unfavorable contacts. This indicates that using high-resolution structural datasets after filtering out unfavorable contacts can improve the performance of knowledge-based discriminatory functions.},

@article{Handl2009,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Decoy datasets, consisting of a solved protein structure and numerous alternative native-like structures, are in common use for the evaluation of scoring functions in protein structure prediction. Several pitfalls with the use of these datasets have been identified in the literature, as well as useful guidelines for generating more effective decoy datasets. We contribute to this ongoing discussion an empirical assessment of several decoy datasets commonly used in experimental studies.

RESULTS: We find that artefacts and sampling issues in the large majority of these data make it trivial to discriminate the native structure. This underlines that evaluation based on the rank/z-score of the native is a weak test of scoring function performance. Moreover, sampling biases present in the way decoy sets are generated or used can strongly affect other types of evaluation measures such as the correlation between score and root mean squared deviation (RMSD) to the native. We demonstrate how, depending on type of bias and evaluation context, sampling biases may lead to both over- or under-estimation of the quality of scoring terms, functions or methods.

abstract = {Machine learning methods are widely used in bioinformatics and computational and systems biology. Here, we review the development of machine learning methods for protein structure prediction, one of the most fundamental problems in structural biology and bioinformatics. Protein structure prediction is such a complex problem that it is often decomposed and attacked at four different levels: 1-D prediction of structural features along the primary sequence of amino acids; 2-D prediction of spatial relationships between amino acids; 3-D prediction of the tertiary structure of a protein; and 4-D prediction of the quaternary structure of a multiprotein complex. A diverse set of both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods has been applied over the years to tackle these problems and has significantly contributed to advancing the state-of-the-art of protein structure prediction. In this paper, we review the development and application of hidden Markov models, neural networks, support vector machines, Bayesian methods, and clustering methods in 1-D, 2-D, 3-D, and 4-D protein structure predictions.},
