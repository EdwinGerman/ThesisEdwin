abstract = {The article presents assessment of the model accuracy estimation methods participating in CASP11. The results of the assessment are expected to be useful to both-developers of the methods and users who way too often are presented with structural models without annotations of accuracy. The main emphasis is placed on the ability of techniques to identify the best models from among several available. Bivariate descriptive statistics and ROC analysis are used to additionally assess the overall correctness of the predicted model accuracy scores, the correlation between the predicted and observed accuracy of models, the effectiveness in distinguishing between good and bad models, the ability to discriminate between reliable and unreliable regions in models, and the accuracy of the coordinate error self-estimates. A rigid-body measure (GDT{\_}TS) and three local-structure-based scores (LDDT, CADaa, and SphereGrinder) are used as reference measures for evaluating methods' performance. Consensus methods, taking advantage of the availability of several models for the same target protein, perform well on the majority of tasks. Methods that predict accuracy on the basis of a single model perform comparably to consensus methods in picking the best models and in the estimation of how accurate is the local structure. More groups than in previous experiments submitted reasonable error estimates of their own models, most likely in response to a recommendation from CASP and the increasing demand from users.

abstract = {Protein structure prediction is an important problem of both intellectual and practical interest. Most protein structure prediction approaches generate multiple candidate models first, and then use a scoring function to select the best model among these candidates. In this work, we develop a scoring function using support vector regression (SVR). Both consensus-based features and features from individual structures are extracted from a training data set containing native protein structures and predicted structural models submitted to CASP5 and CASP6. The SVR learns a scoring function that is a linear combination of these features. We test this scoring function on two data sets. First, when used to rank server models submitted to CASP7, the SVR score selects predictions that are comparable to the best performing server in CASP7, Zhang-Server, and significantly better than all the other servers. Even if the SVR score is not allowed to select Zhang-Server models, the SVR score still selects predictions that are significantly better than all the other servers. In addition, the SVR is able to select significantly better models and yield significantly better Pearson correlation coefficients than the two best Quality Assessment groups in CASP7, QA556 (LEE), and QA634 (Pcons). Second, this work aims to improve the ability of the Robetta server to select best models, and hence we evaluate the performance of the SVR score on ranking the Robetta server template-based models for the CASP7 targets. The SVR selects significantly better models than the Robetta K*Sync consensus alignment score.},

abstract = {Model quality assessment is an important task in protein structure prediction, which has been recently identified as one of the bottlenecks limiting the quality and usefulness of protein structure prediction methods. A new prediction category that evaluates the quality of protein models has been implemented since CASP7. In this study, a machine learning-based method for protein global model quality assessment (GMQA) is presented and the web server can be assessed at http://www.iipl.fudan.edu.cn/gmqa/index.html. The GMQA method takes a protein model as input and outputs the predicted MaxSub score that indicates the absolute quality of the protein model. The proposed method extracts the structural features from the 3D coordinates and assigns an absolute quality score to a model by support vector regression. Three types of features are extracted, including secondary structure, relative solvent accessibility, and contact. The closed test is performed on the CASP7 data set using cross validation. An open testing is performed on the LKF data set. In both tests, good correlations between the predicted and true scores are observed. Furthermore, our method is able to discriminate the native or near-native structures from a set of decoys. We also demonstrate that the GMQA method outperforms two existing methods, i.e. ProQ and Victor/FRST. Our results show that GMQA is a useful tool for model quality assessment and ranking.

abstract = {The inverse protein folding problem, the problem of finding which amino acid sequences fold into a known three-dimensional (3D) structure, can be effectively attacked by finding sequences that are most compatible with the environments of the residues in the 3D structure. The environments are described by: (i) the area of the residue buried in the protein and inaccessible to solvent; (ii) the fraction of side- chain area that is covered by polar atoms (O and N); and (iii) the local secondary structure. Examples of this 3D profile method are presented for four families of proteins: the globins, cyclic AMP (adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate) receptor-like proteins, the periplasmic binding proteins, and the actins. This method is able to detect the structural similarity of the actins and 70- kilodalton heat shock proteins, even though these protein families share no detectable sequence similarity.},

abstract = {The prediction of protein tertiary structure from sequence using molecular energy calculations has not yet been successful; an alternative strategy of recognizing known motifs or folds in sequences looks more promising. We present here a new approach to fold recognition, whereby sequences are fitted directly onto the backbone coordinates of known protein structures. Our method for protein fold recognition involves automatic modelling of protein structures using a given sequence, and is based on the frameworks of known protein folds. The plausibility of each model, and hence the degree of compatibility between the sequence and the proposed structure, is evaluated by means of a set of empirical potentials derived from proteins of known structure. The novel aspect of our approach is that the matching of sequences to backbone coordinates is performed in full three-dimensional space, incorporating specific pair interactions explicitly.},

abstract = {We have developed a new scoring function, the template modeling score (TM-score), to assess the quality of protein structure templates and predicted full-length models by extending the approaches used in Global Distance Test (GDT)1 and MaxSub.2 First, a protein size-dependent scale is exploited to eliminate the inherent protein size dependence of the previous scores and appropriately account for random protein structure pairs. Second, rather than setting specific distance cutoffs and calculating only the fractions with errors below the cutoff, all residue pairs in alignment/modeling are evaluated in the proposed score. For comparison of various scoring functions, we have constructed a large-scale benchmark set of structure templates for 1489 small to medium size proteins using the threading program PROSPECTOR{\_}3 and built the full-length models using MODELLER and TASSER. The TM-score of the initial threading alignments, compared to the GDT and MaxSub scoring functions, shows a much stronger correlation to the quality of the final full-length models. The TM-score is further exploited as an assessment of all 'new fold' targets in the recent CASP5 experiment and shows a close coincidence with the results of human-expert visual assessment. These data suggest that the TM-score is a useful complement to the fully automated assessment of protein structure predictions. The executable program of TM-score is freely downloadable at http://bioinformatics.buffalo.edu/TM-score.},

abstract = {The ability to rank and select the best model is important in protein structure prediction. Model Quality Assessment Programs (MQAPs) are programs developed to perform this task. They can be divided into three categories based on the information they use. Consensus based methods use the similarity to other models, structure-based methods use features calculated from the structure and evolutionary based methods use the sequence similarity between a model and a template. These methods can be trained to predict the overall global quality of a model, that is, how much a model is likely to differ from the native structure. The methods can also be trained to pinpoint which local regions in a model are likely to be incorrect. In CASP7, we participated with three predictors of global and four of local quality using information from the three categories described above. The result shows that the MQAP using consensus, Pcons, was significantly better at predicting both global and local quality compared with MQAPs using only structure or sequence based information.},

The measures are based on Kabsch's formula for the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and the covariance matrix of atomic positions of isotropically distributed ensembles (IDE). By using a Taylor series expansion, it is shown that the RMSD can be expressed solely in terms of the IDE matrices. A fast approximate method is introduced for the pairwise RMSD determination whose computational cost scales linearly with the number of structures. A similarity measure for two structural ensembles that is based on the trace metric of the differences of powers of the IDE matrices is presented. The measures are illustrated for conformational ensembles generated by a molecular dynamics computer simulation of a partially folded A-state analog of ubiquitin.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Evaluating the accuracy of predicted models is critical for assessing structure prediction methods. Because this problem is not trivial, a large number of different assessment measures have been proposed by various authors, and it has already become an active subfield of research (Moult et al. (1997,1999) and CAFASP (Fischer et al. 1999) prediction experiments have demonstrated that it has been difficult to choose one single, 'best' method to be used in the evaluation. Consequently, the CASP3 evaluation was carried out using an extensive set of especially developed numerical measures, coupled with human-expert intervention. As part of our efforts towards a higher level of automation in the structure prediction field, here we investigate the suitability of a fully automated, simple, objective, quantitative and reproducible method that can be used in the automatic assessment of models in the upcoming CAFASP2 experiment. Such a method should (a) produce one single number that measures the quality of a predicted model and (b) perform similarly to human-expert evaluations. RESULTS: MaxSub is a new and independently developed method that further builds and extends some of the evaluation methods introduced at CASP3. MaxSub aims at identifying the largest subset of C(alpha) atoms of a model that superimpose 'well' over the experimental structure, and produces a single normalized score that represents the quality of the model. Because there exists no evaluation method for assessment measures of predicted models, it is not easy to evaluate how good our new measure is. Even though an exact comparison of MaxSub and the CASP3 assessment is not straightforward, here we use a test-bed extracted from the CASP3 fold-recognition models. A rough qualitative comparison of the performance of MaxSub vis-a-vis the human-expert assessment carried out at CASP3 shows that there is a good agreement for the more accurate models and for the better predicting groups. As expected, some differences were observed among the medium to poor models and groups. Overall, the top six predicting groups ranked using the fully automated MaxSub are also the top six groups ranked at CASP3. We conclude that MaxSub is a suitable method for the automatic evaluation of models.},

abstract = {We develop a protocol for estimating the free energy difference between different conformations of the same polypeptide chain. The conformational free energy evaluation combines the CHARMM force field with a continuum treatment of the solvent. In almost all cases studied, experimentally determined structures are predicted to be more stable than misfolded "decoys." This is due in part to the fact that the Coulomb energy of the native protein is consistently lower than that of the decoys. The solvation free energy generally favors the decoys, although the total electrostatic free energy (sum of Coulomb and solvation terms) favors the native structure. The behavior of the solvation free energy is somewhat counterintuitive and, surprisingly, is not correlated with differences in the burial of polar area between native structures and decoys. Rather. the effect is due to a more favorable charge distribution in the native protein, which, as is discussed, will tend to decrease its interaction with the solvent. Our results thus suggest, in keeping with a number of recent studies, that electrostatic interactions may play an important role in determining the native topology of a folded protein. On this basis, a simplified scoring function is derived that combines a Coulomb term with a hydrophobic contact term. This function performs as well as the more complete free energy evaluation in distinguishing the native structure from misfolded decoys. Its computational efficiency suggests that it can be used in protein structure prediction applications, and that it provides a physically well-defined alternative to statistically derived scoring functions.},

For all proteins but one, the overall fragment topology is well predicted, including both secondary and supersecondary structure. The algorithm was also applied to a molecule of unknown conformation, groES, in which X-ray structure determination is presently ongoing. LINUS is an acronym for Local Independently Nucleated Units of Structure. The procedure ascends the folding hierarchy in discrete stages, with concomitant accretion of structure at each step. The chain is represented by simplified geometry and folds under the influence of a primitive energy function.

We developed a model evaluation method to assess the absolute quality of a single protein model using only structural features with support vector machine regression.

We trained and tested the method on the CASP6 dataset using cross-validation. The correlation between predicted and true scores is 0.82. On the independent CASP7 dataset, the correlation averaged over 95 protein targets is 0.76; the average correlation for template-based and ab initio targets is 0.82 and 0.50, respectively. Furthermore, the predicted absolute quality scores can be used to rank models effectively. The average difference (or loss) between the scores of the top-ranked models and the best models is 5.70 on the CASP7 targets. This method performs favorably when compared with the other methods used on the same dataset. Moreover, the predicted absolute quality scores are comparable across models for different proteins. These features make the method a valuable tool for model quality assurance and ranking.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: As an increasing number of protein structures become available, the need for algorithms that can quantify the similarity between protein structures increases as well. Thus, the comparison of proteins' structures, and their clustering accordingly to a given similarity measure, is at the core of today's biomedical research. In this paper, we show how an algorithmic information theory inspired Universal Similarity Metric (USM) can be used to calculate similarities between protein pairs. The method, besides being theoretically supported, is surprisingly simple to implement and computationally efficient. RESULTS: Structural similarity between proteins in four different datasets was measured using the USM. The sample employed represented alpha, beta, alpha-beta, tim-barrel, globins and serpine protein types. The use of the proposed metric allows for a correct measurement of similarity and classification of the proteins in the four datasets. AVAILABILITY: All the scripts and programs used for the preparation of this paper are available at http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/{\~{}}nxk/USM/protocol.html. In that web-page the reader will find a brief description on how to use the various scripts and programs.},

abstract = {Protein modeling could be done on various levels of structural details, from simplified lattice or continuous representations, through high resolution reduced models, employing the united atom representation, to all-atom models of the molecular mechanics. Here I describe a new high resolution reduced model, its force field and applications in the structural proteomics. The model uses a lattice representation with 800 possible orientations of the virtual alpha carbon-alpha carbon bonds. The sampling scheme of the conformational space employs the Replica Exchange Monte Carlo method. Knowledge-based potentials of the force field include: generic protein-like conformational biases, statistical potentials for the short-range conformational propensities, a model of the main chain hydrogen bonds and context-dependent statistical potentials describing the side group interactions. The model is more accurate than the previously designed lattice models and in many applications it is complementary and competitive in respect to the all-atom techniques. The test applications include: the ab initio structure prediction, multitemplate comparative modeling and structure prediction based on sparse experimental data. Especially, the new approach to comparative modeling could be a valuable tool of the structural proteomics. It is shown that the new approach goes beyond the range of applicability of the traditional methods of the protein comparative modeling.},

abstract = {We present a knowledge-based function to score protein decoys based on their similarity to native structure. A set of features is constructed to describe the structure and sequence of the entire protein chain. Furthermore, a qualitative relationship is established between the calculated features and the underlying electromagnetic interaction that dominates this scale. The features we use are associated with residue-residue distances, residue-solvent distances, pairwise knowledge-based potentials and a four-body potential. In addition, we introduce a new target to be predicted, the fitness score, which measures the similarity of a model to the native structure. This new approach enables us to obtain information both from decoys and from native structures. It is also devoid of previous problems associated with knowledge-based potentials. These features were obtained for a large set of native and decoy structures and a back-propagating neural network was trained to predict the fitness score. Overall this new scoring potential proved to be superior to the knowledge-based scoring functions used as its inputs. In particular, in the latest CASP (CASP10) experiment our method was ranked third for all targets, and second for freely modeled hard targets among about 200 groups for top model prediction. Ours was the only method ranked in the top three for all targets and for hard targets. This shows that initial results from the novel approach are able to capture details that were missed by a broad spectrum of protein structure prediction approaches.

abstract = {Here we report an orientation-dependent statistical all-atom potential derived from side-chain packing, named OPUS-PSP. It features a basis set of 19 rigid-body blocks extracted from the chemical structures of all 20 amino acid residues. The potential is generated from the orientation-specific packing statistics of pairs of those blocks in a non-redundant structural database. The purpose of such an approach is to capture the essential elements of orientation dependence in molecular packing interactions. Tests of OPUS-PSP on commonly used decoy sets demonstrate that it significantly outperforms most of the existing knowledge-based potentials in terms of both its ability to recognize native structures and consistency in achieving high Z-scores across decoy sets. As OPUS-PSP excludes interactions among main-chain atoms, its success highlights the crucial importance of side-chain packing in forming native protein structures. Moreover, OPUS-PSP does not explicitly include solvation terms, and thus the potential should perform well when the solvation effect is difficult to determine, such as in membrane proteins. Overall, OPUS-PSP is a generally applicable potential for protein structure modeling, especially for handling side-chain conformations, one of the most difficult steps in high-accuracy protein structure prediction and refinement.},

Double-blind assessments of protein structure prediction methods have indicated that the Rosetta algorithm is perhaps the most successful current method for de novo protein structure prediction. In the Rosetta method, short fragments of known proteins are assembled by a Monte Carlo strategy to yield native-like protein conformations. Using only sequence information, successful Rosetta predictions yield models with typical accuracies of 3–6 A˚ C$\alpha$ root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the experimentally determined structures for contiguous segments of 60 or more residues. For each structure prediction, many short simulations starting from different random seeds are carried out to generate an ensemble of decoy structures that have both favorable local interactions and protein-like global properties. This set is then clustered by structural similarity to identify the broadest free energy minima. The effectiveness of conformation modification operators for energy function optimization is also described in this chapter.},

The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target–template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. The number of protein sequences that can be modeled and the accuracy of the predictions are increasing steadily because of the growth in the number of known protein structures and because of the improvements in the modeling software. Further advances are necessary in recognizing weak sequence–structure similarities, aligning sequences with structures, modeling of rigid body shifts, distortions, loops and side chains, as well as detecting errors in a model. Despite these problems, it is currently possible to model with useful accuracy significant parts of approximately one third of all known protein sequences. The use of individual comparative models in biology is already rewarding and increasing...},

abstract = {The past two years have seen the rapid development of new recognition methods for protein structure prediction. These algorithms 'thread' the sequence of one protein through the known structure of another, looking for an alignment that corresponds to an energetically favorable model structure. Because they are based on energy calculation, rather than evolutionary distance, these methods extend the possibility of structure prediction by comparative modeling to a larger class of new sequences, where similarity to known structures is recognizable by no other means. The strength of the evidence they offer should be judged by objective statistical tests, however, so as to rule out the possibility that favorable scores arise from chance factors such as similarity of length, composition, or the consideration of a large number of alternative alignments. Calculation of objective p-values by analytical means is not yet possible, but it would appear that approximate values may be obtained by simulation, as they are in gapped, global sequence alignment. We propose that the results of threading experiments should include Z-scores relative to the composition-corrected score distribution obtained for shuffled and optimally aligned sequences. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Identifying the best candidate model among an ensemble of alternatives is crucial in protein structure prediction. For this purpose, scoring functions have been developed which either calculate a quality estimate on the basis of a single model or derive a score from the information contained in the ensemble of models generated for a given sequence (i.e., consensus methods). At CASP7, consensus methods have performed considerably better than scoring functions operating on single models. However, consensus methods tend to fail if the best models are far from the center of the dominant structural cluster. At CASP8, we investigated whether our hybrid method QMEANclust may overcome this limitation by combining the QMEAN composite scoring function operating on single models with consensus information. We participated with four different scoring functions in the quality assessment category. The QMEANclust consensus scoring function turned out to be a successful method both for the ranking of entire models but especially for the estimation of the per-residue model quality. In this article, we briefly describe the two scoring functions QMEAN and QMEANclust and discuss their performance in the context of what went right and wrong at CASP8. Both scoring functions are publicly available at http://swissmodel.expasy.org/qmean/.},

abstract = {An essential requirement for theoretical protein structure prediction is an energy function that can discriminate the native from non-native protein conformations. To date most of the energy functions used for this purpose have been extracted from a statistical analysis of the protein structure database, without explicit reference to the physical interactions responsible for protein stability. The use of the statistical functions has been supported by the widespread belief that they are superior for such discrimination to physics-based energy functions. An effective energy function which combined the CHARMM vacuum potential with a Gaussian model for the solvation free energy is tested for its ability to discriminate the native structure of a protein from misfolded conformations; the results are compared with those obtained with the vacuum CHARMM potential. The test is performed on several sets of misfolded structures prepared by others, including sets of about 650 good decoys for six proteins, as well as on misfolded structures of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2. The vacuum CHARMM potential is successful in most cases when energy minimized conformations are considered, but fails when applied to structures relaxed by molecular dynamics. With the effective energy function the native state is always more stable than grossly misfolded conformations both in energy minimized and molecular dynamics-relaxed structures. The present results suggest that molecular mechanics (physics-based) energy functions, complemented by a simple model for the solvation free energy, should be tested for use in the inverse folding problem, and supports their use in studies of the effective energy surface of proteins in solution. Moreover, the study suggests that the belief in the superiority of statistical functions for these purposes may be ill founded.},
