abstract = {Predicting the fold of a protein from its amino acid sequence is one of the grand problems in computational biology. While there has been progress towards a solution, especially when a protein can be modelled based on one or more known structures (templates), in the absence of templates, even the best predictions are generally much less reliable. [1.0]In this paper, we present an approach for predicting the three-dimensional structure of a protein from the sequence alone, when templates of known structure are not available. This approach relies on a simple reconstruction procedure guided by a novel knowledge-based evaluation function implemented as a class of artificial neural networks that we have designed: Neural Network Pairwise Interaction Fields (NNPIF). This evaluation function takes into account the contextual information for each residue and is trained to identify native-like conformations from non-native-like ones by using large sets of decoys as a training set. The training set is generated and then iteratively expanded during successive folding simulations. As NNPIF are fast at evaluating conformations, thousands of models can be processed in a short amount of time, and clustering techniques can be adopted for model selection. Although the results we present here are very preliminary, we consider them to be promising, with predictions being generated at state-of-the-art levels in some of the cases.},

@article{Lindsey2013,
abstract = {Predicting protein structures and simulating protein folding motions are two of the most important problems in computational bi- ology today. Both problems are concerned with understanding how a protein transitions from an unfolded chain of amino acids to its most energetically stable 3D configuration, known as the native structure. Modern folding simulation methods rely on a component known as a scoring function which attemps to distinguish the native structure from one or more non-native structures. Decoy databases are collections of non-native structures that are widely used to test and verify these scor- ing functions. If a scoring function can accurately distinguish between the protein's native structure and the non-native structures in the de- coy database, the scoring function is said to be correct. We have been successful in developing decoy databases with more informative struc- tures that can more readily fool the scoring functions of modern protein folding algorithms. Our belief is that these techniques can be applied to existing decoy databases which will be used to improve the quality of protein folding simulations.},

abstract = {Protein threading has become a popular technique for protein fold recog- nition and structure prediction. However it remains a challenging and unsolved problem to assess the significance or reliability of a threading prediction result. The lack of an effective mechanism for such an assessment has greatly limited fur- ther applications of threading on a genome-scale. We have developed a practical method for assessing the reliability of a threading result, using a neural network approach. As a key goal of threading is to separate true sequence-fold pairs (a pair of proteins that share the same structural fold) from false sequence-fold pairs, we have examined the distribution of true pairs against the many times more false pairs in the parameter space, and discovered that the vast majority of the true pairs fall into a continuous region without any false ones, providing the basis for pattern recognition using a neural network. We have trained a neural network trying to capture the shape of this “true” region. Our preli minary results are quite encouraging and show that our approach is more effective in assessing the prediction reliability than another neural network-based approach employed in the popular threading program GenThreader. This preliminary study also indicates that our current neural network is too simple to accurately capture the overall shape of the true region, and points to directions for further investigation on this highly important and challenging problem. This neural network-based assessment capability has been implemented in our threading program PROSPECT and used during the CASP4 predictions. Our successful performance in CASP4 suggests that even though this trained neural network is far from being perfect, it is fairly effective},

abstract = {The statistical validation of database search results is a complex issue in bottom-up proteomics. The correct and incorrect peptide spectrum match (PSM) scores overlap significantly, making an accurate assessment of true peptide matches challenging. Since the complete separation between the true and false hits is practically never achieved, there is need for better methods and rescoring algorithms to improve upon the primary database search results. Here we describe the calibration and False Discovery Rate (FDR) estimation of database search scores through a dynamic FDR calculation method, FlexiFDR, which increases both the sensitivity and specificity of search results. Modelling a simple linear regression on the decoy hits for different charge states, the method maximized the number of true positives and reduced the number of false negatives in several standard datasets of varying complexity (18-mix, 49-mix, 200-mix) and few complex datasets (E. coli and Yeast) obtained from a wide variety of MS platforms. The net positive gain for correct spectral and peptide identifications was up to 14.81{\%} and 6.2{\%} respectively. The approach is applicable to different search methodologies--separate as well as concatenated database search, high mass accuracy, and semi-tryptic and modification searches. FlexiFDR was also applied to Mascot results and showed better performance than before. We have shown that appropriate threshold learnt from decoys, can be very effective in improving the database search results. FlexiFDR adapts itself to different instruments, data types and MS platforms. It learns from the decoy hits and sets a flexible threshold that automatically aligns itself to the underlying variables of data quality and size.},
