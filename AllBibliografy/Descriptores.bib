abstract = {Specification of the three dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence, also called a "Grand Challenge" problem, has eluded a solution for over six decades. A modestly successful strategy has evolved over the last couple of decades based on development of scoring functions (e.g. mimicking free energy) that can capture native or native-like structures from an ensemble of decoys generated as plausible candidates for the native structure. A scoring function must be fast enough in discriminating the native from unfolded/misfolded structures, and requires validation on a large data set(s) to generate sufficient confidence in the score. Here we develop a scoring function called pcSM that detects true native structure in the top 5 with 93{\%} accuracy from an ensemble of candidate structures. If we eliminate the native from ensemble of decoys then pcSM is able to capture near native structure (RMSD{\textless}=5Ǻ) in top 10 with 86{\%} accuracy. The parameters considered in pcSM are a C-alpha Euclidean metric, secondary structural propensity, surface areas and an intramolecular energy function. pcSM has been tested on 415 systems consisting 142,698 decoys (public and CASP-largest reported hitherto in literature). The average rank for the native is 2.38, a significant improvement over that existing in literature. In-silico protein structure prediction requires robust scoring technique(s). Therefore, pcSM is easily amenable to integration into a successful protein structure prediction strategy. The tool is freely available at http://www.scfbio-iitd.res.in/software/pcsm.jsp.},

@article{Elias2004,
abstract = {Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has emerged as a cornerstone of proteomics owing in part to robust spectral interpretation algorithms. Widely used algorithms do not fully exploit the intensity patterns present in mass spectra. Here, we demonstrate that intensity pattern modeling improves peptide and protein identification from MS/MS spectra. We modeled fragment ion intensities using a machine-learning approach that estimates the likelihood of observed intensities given peptide and fragment attributes. From 1,000,000 spectra, we chose 27,000 with high-quality, nonredundant matches as training data. Using the same 27,000 spectra, intensity was similarly modeled with mismatched peptides. We used these two probabilistic models to compute the relative likelihood of an observed spectrum given that a candidate peptide is matched or mismatched. We used a 'decoy' proteome approach to estimate incorrect match frequency, and demonstrated that an intensity-based method reduces peptide identification error by 50-96{\%} without any loss in sensitivity.},

@article{Bahadur2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Setting the rules for the identification of a stable conformation of a protein is of utmost importance for the efficient generation of structures in computer simulation. For structure prediction, a considerable number of possible models are generated from which the best model has to be selected.

RESULTS: Two scoring functions, Rs and Rp, based on the consideration of packing of residues, which indicate if the conformation of an amino acid sequence is native-like, are presented. These are defined using the solvent accessible surface area (ASA) and the partner number (PN) (other residues that are within 4.5 A) of a particular residue. The two functions evaluate the deviation from the average packing properties (ASA or PN) of all residues in a polypeptide chain corresponding to a model of its three-dimensional structure. While simple in concept and computationally less intensive, both the functions are at least as efficient as any other energy functions in discriminating the native structure from decoys in a large number of standard decoy sets, as well as on models submitted for the targets of CASP7. Rs appears to be slightly more effective than Rp, as determined by the number of times the native structure possesses the minimum value for the function and its separation from the average value for the decoys.

CONCLUSION: Two parameters, Rs and Rp, are discussed that can very efficiently recognize the native fold for a sequence from an ensemble of decoy structures. Unlike many other algorithms that rely on the use of composite scoring function, these are based on a single parameter, viz., the accessible surface area (or the number of residues in contact), but still able to capture the essential attribute of the native fold.},

@article{Aloy2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent advances on high-throughput technologies have produced a vast amount of protein sequences, while the number of high-resolution structures has seen a limited increase. This has impelled the production of many strategies to built protein structures from its sequence, generating a considerable amount of alternative models. The selection of the closest model to the native conformation has thus become crucial for structure prediction. Several methods have been developed to score protein models by energies, knowledge-based potentials and combination of both.

RESULTS: Here, we present and demonstrate a theory to split the knowledge-based potentials in scoring terms biologically meaningful and to combine them in new scores to predict near-native structures. Our strategy allows circumventing the problem of defining the reference state. In this approach we give the proof for a simple and linear application that can be further improved by optimizing the combination of Zscores. Using the simplest composite score (ZECbeta) we obtained predictions similar to state-of-the-art methods. Besides, our approach has the advantage of identifying the most relevant terms involved in the stability of the protein structure. Finally, we also use the composite Zscores to assess the conformation of models and to detect local errors.

CONCLUSION: We have introduced a method to split knowledge-based potentials and to solve the problem of defining a reference state. The new scores have detected near-native structures as accurately as state-of-art methods and have been successful to identify wrongly modeled regions of many near-native conformations.},
