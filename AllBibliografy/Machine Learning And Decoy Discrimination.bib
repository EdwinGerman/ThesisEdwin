abstract = {The memetic algoruthm (MA) is an evolutionary metaheuristic that can be viewed as a hybrid genetic algorithm combined with some kinds of local search. In this paper, we propose a memetic algorithm combined with a support vector machine(SVM) for feature selection and classification in Data mining. The proposed approach tries to find a subset of features that maximizes the classification accuracy rate of SVM. In addition, another hybrid algorithm of MA and SVM with optmized parameters is also developed. The two versions of our proposed method are evaluated on some datasets and compared with some well-known classifiers for data classification. The computational experiments show that the hybrid method MA + SVM with optimized parameters provides competitive results and finds high quality solutions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We present a novel method of protein fold decoy discrimination using machine learning, more specifically using neural networks. Here, decoy discrimination is represented as a machine learning problem, where neural networks are used to learn the native-like features of protein structures using a set of positive and negative training examples. A set of native protein structures provides the positive training examples, while negative training examples are simulated decoy structures obtained by reversing the sequences of native structures. Various features are extracted from the training dataset of positive and negative examples and used as inputs to the neural networks.

RESULTS: Results have shown that the best performing neural network is the one that uses input information comprising of PSI-BLAST 1 profiles of residue pairs, pairwise distance and the relative solvent accessibilities of the residues. This neural network is the best among all methods tested in discriminating the native structure from a set of decoys for all decoy datasets tested.

CONCLUSION: This method is demonstrated to be viable, and furthermore evolutionary information is successfully used in the neural networks to improve decoy discrimination.},

abstract = {Model quality assessment is an important task in protein structure prediction, which has been recently identified as one of the bottlenecks limiting the quality and usefulness of protein structure prediction methods. A new prediction category that evaluates the quality of protein models has been implemented since CASP7. In this study, a machine learning-based method for protein global model quality assessment (GMQA) is presented and the web server can be assessed at http://www.iipl.fudan.edu.cn/gmqa/index.html. The GMQA method takes a protein model as input and outputs the predicted MaxSub score that indicates the absolute quality of the protein model. The proposed method extracts the structural features from the 3D coordinates and assigns an absolute quality score to a model by support vector regression. Three types of features are extracted, including secondary structure, relative solvent accessibility, and contact. The closed test is performed on the CASP7 data set using cross validation. An open testing is performed on the LKF data set. In both tests, good correlations between the predicted and true scores are observed. Furthermore, our method is able to discriminate the native or near-native structures from a set of decoys. We also demonstrate that the GMQA method outperforms two existing methods, i.e. ProQ and Victor/FRST. Our results show that GMQA is a useful tool for model quality assessment and ranking.

abstract = {The article presents an assessment of the ability of the thirty-seven model quality assessment (MQA) methods participating in CASP10 to provide an a priori estimation of the quality of structural models, and of the 67 tertiary structure prediction groups to provide confidence estimates for their predicted coordinates. The assessment of MQA predictors is based on the methods used in previous CASPs, such as correlation between the predicted and observed quality of the models (both at the global and local levels), accuracy of methods in distinguishing between good and bad models as well as good and bad regions within them, and ability to identify the best models in the decoy sets. Several numerical evaluations were used in our analysis for the first time, such as comparison of global and local quality predictors with reference (baseline) predictors and a ROC analysis of the predictors' ability to differentiate between the well and poorly modeled regions. For the evaluation of the reliability of self-assessment of the coordinate errors, we used the correlation between the predicted and observed deviations of the coordinates and a ROC analysis of correctly identified errors in the models. A modified two-stage procedure for testing MQA methods in CASP10 whereby a small number of models spanning the whole range of model accuracy was released first followed by the release of a larger number of models of more uniform quality, allowed a more thorough analysis of abilities and inabilities of different types of methods. Clustering methods were shown to have an advantage over the single- and quasi-single- model methods on the larger datasets. At the same time, the evaluation revealed that the size of the dataset has smaller influence on the global quality assessment scores (for both clustering and nonclustering methods), than its diversity. Narrowing the quality range of the assessed models caused significant decrease in accuracy of ranking for global quality predictors but essentially did not change the results for local predictors. Self-assessment error estimates submitted by the majority of groups were poor overall, with two research groups showing significantly better results than the remaining ones.

abstract = {Reliable prediction of model accuracy is an important unsolved problem in protein structure modeling. To address this problem, we studied 24 individual assessment scores, including physics-based energy functions, statistical potentials, and machine learning-based scoring functions. Individual scores were also used to construct approximately 85,000 composite scoring functions using support vector machine (SVM) regression. The scores were tested for their abilities to identify the most native-like models from a set of 6000 comparative models of 20 representative protein structures. Each of the 20 targets was modeled using a template of {\textless}30{\%} sequence identity, corresponding to challenging comparative modeling cases. The best SVM score outperformed all individual scores by decreasing the average RMSD difference between the model identified as the best of the set and the model with the lowest RMSD (DeltaRMSD) from 0.63 A to 0.45 A, while having a higher Pearson correlation coefficient to RMSD (r=0.87) than any other tested score. The most accurate score is based on a combination of the DOPE non-hydrogen atom statistical potential; surface, contact, and combined statistical potentials from MODPIPE; and two PSIPRED/DSSP scores. It was implemented in the SVMod program, which can now be applied to select the final model in various modeling problems, including fold assignment, target-template alignment, and loop modeling.},

abstract = {phi-psi maps of N-acetyl alanine N'-methyl amide have been computed using the CHARMM potential, the all-atom AMBER potential, and the ECEPP/2 potential, before and after adiabatic relaxation. Maps using the CHARMM and AMBER potentials were determined with values of 1.0 and 4.0 for the dielectric constant epsilon, and with a distance dependent dielectric constant. Adiabatic relaxation was carried out using flexible geometry for the CHARMM and AMBER potentials, and using rigid geometry for the AMBER and ECEPP potentials. In all cases, the lowest energy was found in the C7eq region (phi approximately -70 degrees, psi approximately 70 degrees). The maps with CHARMM and AMBER with epsilon = 4.0 and with ECEPP, without adiabatic relaxation, were broadly similar but differed in the relative energies allotted to high-energy regions of the map. After adiabatic relaxation with rigid geometry, the map with ECEPP, and the map with AMBER using a distance-dependent dielectric constant, agreed fairly well apart from differences in the relative energies of the alpha R, alpha L, and C7ax regions. After adiabatic relaxation with flexible geometry, the maps with CHARMM and AMBER became very similar; the lowest energies were observed in the C7eq region, the C5 region (phi approximately -150 degrees, psi approximately 150 degrees) and the C7ax region (phi approximately 70 degrees, psi approximately -70 degrees). Breakdown of the energies, after adiabatic relaxation, into electrostatic, nonbonded, and geometric (including torsional) contributions, showed that (1) with fixed geometry, the nonbonded and torsional contribution to the ECEPP and AMBER potentials were very similar, but the electrostatic contributions were markedly different; (2) with flexible geometry, the nonbonded contribution to the CHARMM and AMBER potentials did not vary greatly over the whole map. The phi-psi maps were subjected to three simple comparisons with experiment. (1) The maps were used to predict the characteristic ratio for poly-L-alanine, and the results were compared with experimental findings (D.A. Brant and P.J. Flory, J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 87, 2788-2791, 1965). The agreement with experiment was acceptable for ECEPP, and for CHARMM after adiabatic relaxation, marginal for AMBER after adiabatic relaxation, and unsatisfactory for CHARMM or AMBER without adiabatic relaxation. (2) Deviations of bond angles from their equilibrium values, in energy-minimized conformations, were compared with values deduced from crystals of terminally-blocked amino acids. With both the CHARMM and AMBER potentials using flexible geometry, one or more excessive deviations was observed in the C7ax local minimum.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Evaluating the accuracy of predicted models is critical for assessing structure prediction methods. Because this problem is not trivial, a large number of different assessment measures have been proposed by various authors, and it has already become an active subfield of research (Moult et al. (1997,1999) and CAFASP (Fischer et al. 1999) prediction experiments have demonstrated that it has been difficult to choose one single, 'best' method to be used in the evaluation. Consequently, the CASP3 evaluation was carried out using an extensive set of especially developed numerical measures, coupled with human-expert intervention. As part of our efforts towards a higher level of automation in the structure prediction field, here we investigate the suitability of a fully automated, simple, objective, quantitative and reproducible method that can be used in the automatic assessment of models in the upcoming CAFASP2 experiment. Such a method should (a) produce one single number that measures the quality of a predicted model and (b) perform similarly to human-expert evaluations. RESULTS: MaxSub is a new and independently developed method that further builds and extends some of the evaluation methods introduced at CASP3. MaxSub aims at identifying the largest subset of C(alpha) atoms of a model that superimpose 'well' over the experimental structure, and produces a single normalized score that represents the quality of the model. Because there exists no evaluation method for assessment measures of predicted models, it is not easy to evaluate how good our new measure is. Even though an exact comparison of MaxSub and the CASP3 assessment is not straightforward, here we use a test-bed extracted from the CASP3 fold-recognition models. A rough qualitative comparison of the performance of MaxSub vis-a-vis the human-expert assessment carried out at CASP3 shows that there is a good agreement for the more accurate models and for the better predicting groups. As expected, some differences were observed among the medium to poor models and groups. Overall, the top six predicting groups ranked using the fully automated MaxSub are also the top six groups ranked at CASP3. We conclude that MaxSub is a suitable method for the automatic evaluation of models.},

abstract = {Differential evolution (DE) is an efficient and powerful population-based stochastic search technique for solving optimization problems over continuous space, which has been widely applied in many scientific and engineering fields. However, the success of DE in solving a specific problem crucially depends on appropriately choosing trial vector generation strategies and their associated control parameter values. Employing a trial-and-error scheme to search for the most suitable strategy and its associated parameter settings requires high computational costs. Moreover, at different stages of evolution, different strategies coupled with different parameter settings may be required in order to achieve the best performance. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive DE (SaDE) algorithm, in which both trial vector generation strategies and their associated control parameter values are gradually self-adapted by learning from their previous experiences in generating promising solutions. Consequently, a more suitable generation strategy along with its parameter settings can be determined adaptively to match different phases of the search process/evolution.

The paper is original in what concerns two main aspects. First, it provides an up-to-date overview that is fully devoted to evolutionary algorithms for clustering, is not limited to any particular kind of evolutionary approach, and comprises advanced topics like multiobjective and ensemble-based evolutionary clustering. Second, it provides a taxonomy that highlights some very important aspects in the context of evolutionary data clustering, namely, fixed or variable number of clusters, cluster-oriented or nonoriented operators, context-sensitive or context-insensitive operators, guided or unguided operators, binary, integer, or real encodings, centroid-based, medoid-based, label-based, tree-based, or graph-based representations, among others. A number of references are provided that describe applications of evolutionary algorithms for clustering in different domains, such as image processing, computer security, and bioinformatics.

abstract = {Fold recognition techniques assist the exploration of protein structures, and web-based servers are part of the standard set of tools used in the analysis of biochemical problems. Despite their success, current methods are only able to predict the correct fold in a relatively small number of cases. We propose an approach that improves the selection of correct folds from among the results of two methods implemented as web servers (SAMT99 and 3DPSSM). Our approach is based on the training of a system of neural networks with models generated by the servers and a set of associated characteristics such as the quality of the sequence-structure alignment, distribution of sequence features (sequence-conserved positions and apolar residues), and compactness of the resulting models. Our results show that it is possible to detect adequate folds to model 80{\%} of the sequences with a high level of confidence. The improvements achieved by taking into account sequence characteristics open the door to future improvements by directly including such factors in the step of model generation. This approach has been implemented as an automatic system LIBELLULA, available as a public web server at http://www.pdg.cnb.uam.es/servers/libellula.html.},

abstract = {We present a knowledge-based function to score protein decoys based on their similarity to native structure. A set of features is constructed to describe the structure and sequence of the entire protein chain. Furthermore, a qualitative relationship is established between the calculated features and the underlying electromagnetic interaction that dominates this scale. The features we use are associated with residue-residue distances, residue-solvent distances, pairwise knowledge-based potentials and a four-body potential. In addition, we introduce a new target to be predicted, the fitness score, which measures the similarity of a model to the native structure. This new approach enables us to obtain information both from decoys and from native structures. It is also devoid of previous problems associated with knowledge-based potentials. These features were obtained for a large set of native and decoy structures and a back-propagating neural network was trained to predict the fitness score. Overall this new scoring potential proved to be superior to the knowledge-based scoring functions used as its inputs. In particular, in the latest CASP (CASP10) experiment our method was ranked third for all targets, and second for freely modeled hard targets among about 200 groups for top model prediction. Ours was the only method ranked in the top three for all targets and for hard targets. This shows that initial results from the novel approach are able to capture details that were missed by a broad spectrum of protein structure prediction approaches.

abstract = {Knowing the quality of a protein structure model is important for its appropriate usage. We developed a model evaluation method to assess the absolute quality of a single protein model using only structural features with support vector machine regression. The method assigns an absolute quantitative score (i.e. GDT-TS) to a model by comparing its secondary structure, relative solvent accessibility, contact map, and beta sheet structure with their counterparts predicted from its primary sequence. We trained and tested the method on the CASP6 dataset using cross-validation. The correlation between predicted and true scores is 0.82. On the independent CASP7 dataset, the correlation averaged over 95 protein targets is 0.76; the average correlation for template-based and ab initio targets is 0.82 and 0.50, respectively. Furthermore, the predicted absolute quality scores can be used to rank models effectively. The average difference (or loss) between the scores of the top-ranked models and the best models is 5.70 on the CASP7 targets. This method performs favorably when compared with the other methods used on the same dataset. Moreover, the predicted absolute quality scores are comparable across models for different proteins. These features make the method a valuable tool for model quality assurance and ranking.},

abstract = {Computational protein tertiary structure prediction has made significant progress over the last decade due to the advancement of techniques and the growth of sequence and structure databases. However, it is still not very easy to predict the accuracy of a given predicted structure. Predicting the accuracy, or quality assessment of a prediction model, is crucial for a practical use of the model such as biochemical experimental design and drug design. Recently several model quality assessment programs (MQAPs) have been proposed for assessing global and local accuracy of predicted structures. We will start with reviewing the current status of protein structure prediction methods with an emphasis on the source of errors. Then existing MQAPs are classified into several categories and each is discussed. The categories include methods which evaluate the quality of template-target alignments, those which evaluate stereochemical irregularities of prediction models, and methods which integrate several features into a composite quality assessment score.},

abstract = {Biological named entity recognition, the identification of biological terms in text, is essential for biomedical information extraction. Machine learning-based approaches have been widely applied in this area. However, the recognition performance of current approaches could still be improved. Our novel approach is to combine support vector machines (SVMs) and conditional random fields (CRFs), which can complement and facilitate each other. During the hybrid process, we use SVM to separate biological terms from non-biological terms, before we use CRFs to determine the types of biological terms, which makes full use of the power of SVM as a binary-class classifier and the data-labeling capacity of CRFs. We then merge the results of SVM and CRFs. To remove any inconsistencies that might result from the merging, we develop a useful algorithm and apply two rules. To ensure biological terms with a maximum length are identified, we propose a maximal bidirectional squeezing approach that finds the longest term. We also add a positive gain to rare events to reinforce their probability and avoid bias. Our approach will also gradually extend the context so more contextual information can be included. We examined the performance of four approaches with GENIA corpus and JNLPBA04 data. The combination of SVM and CRFs improved performance. The macro-precision, macro-recall, and macro-F(1) of the SVM-CRFs hybrid approach surpassed conventional SVM and CRFs. After applying the new algorithms, the macro-F1 reached 91.67{\%} with the GENIA corpus and 84.04{\%} with the JNLPBA04 data.},

abstract = {The results of the first Critical Assessment of Fully Automated Structure Prediction (CAFASP-1) are presented. The objective was to evaluate the success rates of fully automatic web servers for fold recognition which are available to the community. This study was based on the targets used in the third meeting on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP-3). However, unlike CASP-3, the study was not a blind trial, as it was held after the structures of the targets were known. The aim was to assess the performance of methods without the user intervention that several groups used in their CASP-3 submissions. Although it is clear that "human plus machine" predictions are superior to automated ones, this CAFASP-1 experiment is extremely valuable for users of our methods; it provides an indication of the performance of the methods alone, and not of the "human plus machine" performance assessed in CASP. This information may aid users in choosing which programs they wish to use and in evaluating the reliability of the programs when applied to their specific prediction targets. In addition, evaluation of fully automated methods is particularly important to assess their applicability at genomic scales. For each target, groups submitted the top-ranking folds generated from their servers. In CAFASP-1 we concentrated on fold-recognition web servers only and evaluated only recognition of the correct fold, and not, as in CASP-3, alignment accuracy. Although some performance differences appeared within each of the four target categories used here, overall, no single server has proved markedly superior to the others. The results showed that current fully automated fold recognition servers can often identify remote similarities when pairwise sequence search methods fail. Nevertheless, in only a few cases outside the family-level targets has the score of the top-ranking fold been significant enough to allow for a confident fully automated prediction. Because the goals, rules, and procedures of CAFASP-1 were different from those used at CASP-3, the results reported here are not comparable with those reported in CASP-3. Nevertheless, it is clear that current automated fold recognition methods can not yet compete with "human-expert plus machine" predictions. Finally, CAFASP-1 has been useful in identifying the requirements for a future blind trial of automated served-based protein structure prediction},

The relationship between protein sequence and structure often serves as a basis for protein structure QA. In this work, we developed a new Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to assess the compatibility of protein sequence and structure for capturing their complex relationship. More specifically, the emission of the HMM consists of protein local structures in angular space, secondary structures, and sequence profiles. This model has two capabilities: (1) encoding local structure of each position by jointly considering sequence and structure information, and (2) assigning a global score to estimate the overall quality of a predicted structure, as well as local scores to assess the quality of specific regions of a structure, which provides useful guidance for targeted structure refinement. We compared the HMM model to state-of-art single structure quality assessment methods OPUSCA, DFIRE, GOAP, and RW in protein structure selection. Computational results showed our new score HMM.Z can achieve better overall selection performance on the benchmark datasets.},

abstract = {Model quality assessment is an important task in protein structure prediction, which has been recently identified as one of the bottlenecks limiting the quality and usefulness of protein structure prediction methods. A new prediction category that evaluates the quality of protein models has been implemented since CASP7. In this study, a machine learning-based method for protein global model quality assessment (GMQA) is presented and the web server can be assessed at http://www.iipl.fudan.edu.cn/gmqa/index.html. The GMQA method takes a protein model as input and outputs the predicted MaxSub score that indicates the absolute quality of the protein model. The proposed method extracts the structural features from the 3D coordinates and assigns an absolute quality score to a model by support vector regression. Three types of features are extracted, including secondary structure, relative solvent accessibility, and contact. The closed test is performed on the CASP7 data set using cross validation. An open testing is performed on the LKF data set. In both tests, good correlations between the predicted and true scores are observed. Furthermore, our method is able to discriminate the native or near-native structures from a set of decoys. We also demonstrate that the GMQA method outperforms two existing methods, i.e. ProQ and Victor/FRST. Our results show that GMQA is a useful tool for model quality assessment and ranking.

abstract = {Genetic algorithms (GAs) are multi-dimensional and stochastic search methods, involving complex interactions among their parameters. For last two decades, researchers have been trying to understand the mechanics of GA parameter interactions by using various techniques. The methods include careful 'functional' decomposition of parameter interactions, empirical studies, and Markov chain analysis. Although the complex knot of these interactions are getting loose with such analyses, it still remains an open question in the mind of a new-comer to the field or to a GA-practitioner as to what values of GA parameters (such as population size, choice of GA operators, operator probabilities, and others) to use in an arbitrary problem. In this paper, we investigate the performance of simple tripartite GAs on a number of simple to complex test problems from a practical standpoint. Since function evaluations are most time-consuming in a real-world problem, we compare different GAs for a fixed number of function evaluations. Based on probability calculations and simulation results, it is observed that for solving simple problems (unimodal or small modality problems) mutation operator plays an important role, although crossover operator can also solve these problems. However, two operators (when applied alone) have two different working zones for population size. For complex problems involving massive multimodality and misleadingness (deception), crossover operator is the key search operator and performs reliably with an adequate population size. Based on these studies, it is recommended that when in doubt, the use of the crossover operator with an adequate population size is a reliable approach.},

abstract = {An accurate scoring function is required for protein structure prediction. The scoring function should distinguish the native structure among model structures (decoys) and it also should have correlation with the quality of the decoys. However, we had observed the trade-off between the two requirements for seven all-atom distance dependent potentials in the previous study, where the native structure could be discriminated by examining the fine atomic details, whereas the correlation could be improved by examining coarse-grained interactions, To overcome this problem, in this study, we tried to make an improved scoring function by combining the seven potentials. First, the seven potentials were normalized by the expected energy values of the native and reference states of the target protein. Second, the relationship between the seven normalized energies and the quality (GDT{\_}TS) of the structure were learned using support vector regression with the decoy sets of CASP6 as the training set. Then the meta-score was obtained as the predicted GDT{\_}TS and it was tested with the decoys of the CASP7 experiment. The meta-score showed improvement in correlations with the GDT{\_}TS and in the Z-score of the native structure. It also showed comparable performances in the GDT and enrichment criteria, with the best component potentials. The meta-score could be also used as the absolute quality of the structures. Our study suggests the benefit of combining several different scoring functions for model evaluation.},

Three statistical-learning approaches were evaluated to predict the quality of a protein model starting from an optimum subset of features.

abstract = {Predicting protein 3D structures from the amino acid sequence still remains as an unsolved problem after five decades of efforts. If the target protein has a homologue already solved, the task is relatively easy and high-resolution models can be built by copying the framework of the solved structure. However, such a modelling procedure does not help answer the question of how and why a protein adopts its specific structure. If structure homologues (occasionally ana- logues) do not exist, or exist but cannot be identified, models have to be constructed from scratch. This procedure, called ab initio modelling, is essential for a complete solution to the protein structure prediction problem; it can also help us understand the physicochemical principle of how proteins fold in nature. Currently, the accuracy of ab initio modelling is low and the success is limited to small proteins ({\textless}100 residues). In this chapter, we give a review on the field of ab initio modelling. Focus will be put on three key factors of the modelling algorithms: energy function, conformational search, and model selection. Progresses and advances of a variety of algorithms will be discussed.},

abstract = {The ability to separate correct models of protein structures from less correct models is of the greatest importance for protein structure prediction methods. Several studies have examined the ability of different types of energy function to detect the native, or native-like, protein structure from a large set of decoys. In contrast to earlier studies, we examine here the ability to detect models that only show limited structural similarity to the native structure. These correct models are defined by the existence of a fragment that shows significant similarity between this model and the native structure. It has been shown that the existence of such fragments is useful for comparing the performance between different fold recognition methods and that this performance correlates well with performance in fold recognition. We have developed ProQ, a neural- network-based method to predict the quality of a protein model that extracts structural features, such as frequency of atom–atom contacts, and predicts the quality of a model, as measured either by LGscore or MaxSub. We show that ProQ performs at least as well as other measures when identifying the native structure and is better at the detection of correct models. This performance is maintained over several different test sets. ProQ can also be combined with the Pcons fold recognition predictor (Pmodeller) to increase its performance, with the main advantage being the elimination of a few high-scoring incorrect models. Pmodeller was successful in CASP5 and results from the latest LiveBench, LiveBench-6, indicating that Pmodeller has a higher specificity than Pcons alone},

The speed of the method, along with its sensitivity and very low false-positive rate makes it ideal for automatically predicting the structure of all the proteins in a translated bacterial genome (proteome). The method has been applied to the genome of Mycoplasma genitalium, and analysis of the results shows that as many as 46 {\%} of the proteins derived from the predicted protein coding regions have a significant relationship to a protein of known structure.

abstract = {SUMMARY: Model Quality Assessment Programs (MQAP) are used to predict the quality of modeled protein structures. These usually use two approaches: methods using consensus of many alternative models and methods only requiring a single model to do its prediction. The consensus methods are useful to improve overall accuracy, however they frequently fail to pick out the best possible model, nor can they be used to generate and score new structures. Single-model methods on the other hand do not have these inherent shortcomings and can be used both to sample new structures and to improve existing consensus methods. Here, we present ProQM-resample, a membrane protein specific single-model MQAP, that couples side-chain resampling with MQAP rescoring by ProQM to improve model selection. The side-chain resampling is able to improve side-chain packing for 96{\%} of all models, and improve model selection by 24{\%} as measured by the sum of Z-score for the first ranked model (from 25.0 to 31.1), even better than the state-of-the-art consensus method Pcons. The improved model selection can be attributed to the improved side-chain quality, which is enables the MQAP to rescue good backbone models with poor side-chain packing.

The method that can predict the absolute local quality of individual residues in a single protein model is rare, yet particularly needed for using, ranking and refining protein models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We developed a machine learning tool (SMOQ) that can predict the distance deviation of each residue in a single protein model. SMOQ uses support vector machines (SVM) with protein sequence and structural features (i.e. basic feature set), including amino acid sequence, secondary structures, solvent accessibilities, and residue-residue contacts to make predictions. We also trained a SVM model with two new additional features (profiles and SOV scores) on 20 CASP8 targets and found that including them can only improve the performance when real deviations between native and model are higher than 5{\AA}. The SMOQ tool finally released uses the basic feature set trained on 85 CASP8 targets. Moreover, SMOQ implemented a way to convert predicted local quality scores into a global quality score. SMOQ was tested on the 84 CASP9 single-domain targets. The average difference between the residue-specific distance deviation predicted by our method and the actual distance deviation on the test data is 2.637{\AA}. The global quality prediction accuracy of the tool is comparable to other good tools on the same benchmark.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: SMOQ is a useful tool for protein single model quality assessment.

abstract = {Motivation: Increasing use of structural modeling for understanding structure–function relationships in proteins has led to the need to ensure that the protein models being used are of acceptable quality. Quality of a given protein structure can be assessed by comparing various intrinsic structural properties of the protein to those observed in high-resolution protein structures.Results: In this study, we present tools to compare a given structure to high-resolution crystal structures. We assess packing by calculating the total void volume, the percentage of unsatisfied hydrogen bonds, the number of steric clashes and the scaling of the accessible surface area. We assess covalent geometry by determining bond lengths, angles, dihedrals and rotamers. The statistical parameters for the above measures, obtained from high-resolution crystal structures enable us to provide a quality-score that points to specific areas where a given protein structural model needs improvement.Availability and Implementation: We provide these tools that appraise protein structures in the form of a web server Gaia (http://chiron.dokhlab.org).

abstract = {The aim of any data mining technique is to build an efficient predictive or descriptive model of a large amount of data. Applications of evolutionary algorithms have been found to be particularly useful for automatic processing of large quantities of raw noisy data for optimal parameter setting and to discover significant and meaningful information. Many real-life data mining problems involve multiple conflicting measures of performance, or objectives, which need to be optimized simultaneously. Under this context, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms are gradually finding more and more applications in the domain of data mining since the beginning of the last decade. In this two-part paper, we have made a comprehensive survey on the recent developments of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms for data mining problems. In this paper, Part I, some basic concepts related to multiobjective optimization and data mining are provided. Subsequently, various multiobjective evolutionary approaches for two major data mining tasks, namely feature selection and classification, are surveyed. In Part II of this paper, we have surveyed different multiobjective evolutionary algorithms for clustering, association rule mining, and several other data mining tasks, and provided a general discussion on the scopes for future research in this domain.},

abstract = {Quality assessment (QA) for predicted protein structural models is an important and challenging research problem in protein structure prediction. Consensus Global Distance Test (CGDT) methods assess each decoy (predicted structural model) based on its structural similarity to all others in a decoy set and has been proved to work well when good decoys are in a majority cluster. Scoring functions evaluate each single decoy based on its structural properties. Both methods have their merits and limitations. In this paper, we present a novel method called PWCom, which consists of two neural networks sequentially to combine CGDT and single model scoring methods such as RW, DDFire and OPUS-Ca. Specifically, for every pair of decoys, the difference of the corresponding feature vectors is input to the first neural network which enables one to predict whether the decoy-pair are significantly different in terms of their GDT scores to the native. If yes, the second neural network is used to decide which one of the two is closer to the native structure. The quality score for each decoy in the pool is based on the number of winning times during the pairwise comparisons. Test results on three benchmark datasets from different model generation methods showed that PWCom significantly improves over consensus GDT and single scoring methods. The QA server (MUFOLD-Server) applying this method in CASP 10 QA category was ranked the second place in terms of Pearson and Spearman correlation performance.},

@article{Samudrala1998,
abstract = {We present a formalism to compute the probability of an amino acid sequence conformation being native-like, given a set of pairwise atom-atom distances. The formalism is used to derive three discriminatory functions with different types of representations for the atom-atom contacts observed in a database of protein structures. These functions include two virtual atom representations and one all-heavy atom representation. When applied to six different decoy sets containing a range of correct and incorrect conformations of amino acid sequences, the all-atom distance-dependent discriminatory function is able to identify correct from incorrect more often than the discriminatory functions using approximate representations. We illustrate the importance of using a detailed atomic description for obtaining the most accurate discrimination, and the necessity for testing discriminatory functions against a wide variety of decoys. The discriminatory function is also shown to be capable of capturing the fine details of atom-atom preferences. These results suggest that the all-atom distance-dependent discriminatory function will be useful for protein structure prediction and model refinement.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel hybrid genetic algorithm for feature selection. Local search operations are devised and embedded in hybrid GAs to fine-tune the search. The operations are parameterized in terms of their fine-tuning power, and their effectiveness and timing requirements are analyzed and compared. The hybridization technique produces two desirable effects: a significant improvement in the final performance and the acquisition of subset-size control. The hybrid GAs showed better convergence properties compared to the classical GAs. A method of performing rigorous timing analysis was developed, in order to compare the timing requirement of the conventional and the proposed algorithms. Experiments performed with various standard data sets revealed that the proposed hybrid GA is superior to both a simple GA and sequential search algorithms.},

abstract = {An accurate score function for detecting the most native-like models among a huge number of decoy sets is essential to the protein structure prediction. In this work, we developed a novel integrated score function (SVR{\_}CAF) to discriminate native structures from decoys, as well as to rank near-native structures and select best decoys when native structures are absent. SVR{\_}CAF is a machine learning score, which incorporates the contact energy based score (CE{\_}score), amino acid network based score (AAN{\_}score), and the fast Fourier transform based score (FFT{\_}score). The score function was evaluated with four decoy sets for its discriminative ability and it shows higher overall performance than the state-of-the-art score functions.
